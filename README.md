# optimist-India


As per the current situation going in whole world we just wanted to do some good things for the society, so this inspired us make a website where we can share positivity through news so that at this critical situation people should get to know something positive too.

While working on this project we learned many new attributes,methods using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery. We learnt working using APIs .And on the backend with nodeJS which was little intimidating but we learned alot and most importantly we got to know new good things happening all around the world.
